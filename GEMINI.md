*   **Freemium/Trial:** Offer a limited free tier or a free trial period to allow SMEs to experience the value of our AI agents firsthand.
*   **Transparent Credit System (if applicable):** If a credit system is is used, ensure it is simple, transparent, and clearly communicates the cost per task.
*   Consulting and training fees

## Operational Enhancements
*   **Task Management System:** Deployed a new centralized task management system with a dedicated API. This enhances operational efficiency and provides a scalable infrastructure for task tracking and collaboration across all AI agents. Clear and consistent reporting from all agents is crucial for effective strategic oversight and continuous alignment. A web-based interface for task management is currently under development to provide a user-friendly way to list, filter, search, and edit tasks across all agents.
*   **Robust Infrastructure and Inter-Agent Communication:** Prioritize the development and maintenance of a resilient and reliable technical infrastructure that ensures seamless communication and data exchange between all AI agents and the centralized task management system. This includes addressing and proactively preventing issues related to API accessibility, command execution, and consistent task tracking to maintain operational continuity and efficiency.

### API Usage Examples for AI Agents

AI Agents can interact with the centralized task management system using the `unified_api_client.py` script. Below are examples for common task operations:

#### 1. Create a New Task

Use this command to create a new task in the system.

```bash
python backend/unified_api_client.py create_task \
  --title "Develop new feature for AI Agent" \
  --creator_agent_id "Developer" \
  --category "Product Development" \
  --description "Implement a new feature to enhance AI Agent capabilities." \
  --assigned_agent_id "Core Developer" \
  --priority 4 \
  --due_date "2025-10-01" \
  --ai_notes "Initial thoughts on implementation: Consider modular design."
```

#### 2. Get Tasks

Use this command to retrieve tasks. You can filter by `task_id`, `creator_agent_id`, `assigned_agent_id`, `status`, or `statuses`.

**Get a specific task by ID:**

```bash
python backend/unified_api_client.py get_tasks --task_id <TASK_ID>
```

**Get tasks by creator agent:**

```bash
python backend/unified_api_client.py get_tasks --creator_agent_id "CEO"
```

**Get tasks by status:**

```bash
python backend/unified_api_client.py get_tasks --status "Proposal"
```

**Get tasks by multiple statuses:**

```bash
python backend/unified_api_client.py get_tasks --statuses "In Progress" "Awaiting Human Action"
```

#### 3. Update an Existing Task

Use this command to modify an existing task. You must provide the `task_id` and at least one field to update.

```bash
python backend/unified_api_client.py update_task \
  --task_id <TASK_ID> \
  --status "In Progress" \
  --ai_notes "Progress update: Frontend integration started." \
  --priority 2
```

**Note:** Replace `<TASK_ID>` with the actual task ID obtained from a `create_task` operation. Ensure the `task_api.py` server is running before executing these commands.

*   **Emerging AI Agent Technologies Integration:**
    *   **Strategic R&D Investment:** Allocate dedicated resources for research and development into Large Action Models (LAMs) and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), focusing on practical applications for SME pain points.
    *   **Talent Development:** Invest in training and upskilling the existing development team in emerging AI agent technologies and frameworks.
    *   **Ethical AI Framework:** Continuously refine and apply our ethical AI framework to address the complexities introduced by more autonomous agents.
    *   **Partnerships:** Explore partnerships with academic institutions or specialized AI research labs to accelerate knowledge acquisition and development in these areas.
    *   **Pilot Programs:** Initiate small-scale pilot programs with select SMEs to test and validate the effectiveness of LAMs and MAS in real-world scenarios.
*   **Task Status Definitions:**
    *   **Awaiting Human Action:** This status is for tasks that have been completed by an AI agent but require human intervention for final deployment, review, or action (e.g., posting a LinkedIn update, final approval of a document).
    *   **Done:** This status signifies that a task is fully completed and operational in the real world, requiring no further action from either AI agents or humans.
