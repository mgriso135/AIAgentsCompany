# AIAgentsCompany

This repository contains the work of a company powered by two AI agents: a Lead Developer and a Marketing Manager. A human Business Analyst oversees their work.

## Getting Started

To interact with the AI agents and manage tasks, you will need the `gemini-cli` tool.

### Installation

1.  **Install Node.js:** If you don't have Node.js installed, download and install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2.  **Install gemini-cli:** Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
    ```bash
    npm install -g gemini-cli
    ```

## Folder Structure

- `launch_dev_agent.ps1` & `run_dev_agent.bat`: Scripts to run the Developer AI agent.
- `launch_mktg_agent.ps1` & `run_mktg_agent.bat`: Scripts to run the Marketing AI agent.
- `gemini_agents/`: Contains the work products of the AI agents.
  - `_SHARED_BRIEFING.md`: A shared communication channel for the agents, used for high-level strategic alignment and cross-agent communication.
  - `developer/`: The Developer agent's work.
    - `developer_tasks.csv`: The Developer agent's dedicated task list, reviewed and prioritized by the Business Analyst.
    - `developer_memory.md`: The Developer agent's long-term memory file, storing learned facts and operational knowledge.
    - `log_2025-08-20.md`: The developer's log for August 20th, 2025.
  - `marketing/`: The Marketing agent's work.
    - `20250820_initial_marketing_plan.md`: The initial marketing plan for August 20th, 2025.
    - `marketing_tasks.csv`: The Marketing agent's dedicated task list, reviewed and prioritized by the Business Analyst.
    - `marketing_memory.md`: The Marketing agent's long-term memory file, storing learned facts and operational knowledge.

## Roles

*   **Lead Developer (AI):** Responsible for all software development. Operates with a dedicated `developer_tasks.csv` for task management and `developer_memory.md` for long-term knowledge retention.
*   **Marketing Manager (AI):** Responsible for all marketing activities. Operates with a dedicated `marketing_tasks.csv` for task management and `marketing_memory.md` for long-term knowledge retention.
*   **Business Analyst (Human):** Oversees the project and acts as the primary interface for the AI agents.
    *   **Task Management:** Reviews, approves, and prioritizes tasks within each agent's `_tasks.csv` file.
    *   **Strategic Alignment:** Utilizes `_SHARED_BRIEFING.md` for high-level communication and to ensure cross-agent strategic alignment.
    *   **Real-World Interface:** Serves as the bridge between the AI agents and the real world, handling tasks that require human interaction, external communication, or capabilities beyond the agents' autonomous reach.
    *   **Analysis:** Analyzes the results and outputs generated by both AI agents.

## Usage: Managing Task Lists

The AI agents manage their tasks using dedicated CSV files (`developer_tasks.csv` and `marketing_tasks.csv`). As a Business Analyst, you will interact with these files to assign, prioritize, and track tasks.

### Best Practices for Task Management:

1.  **Assigning Tasks:**
    *   Open the relevant `_tasks.csv` file (e.g., `gemini_agents/developer/developer_tasks.csv`) in a spreadsheet editor or a text editor.
    *   Add a new row for each task. Ensure you follow the existing column structure (e.g., `Task ID`, `Description`, `Status`, `Priority`).
    *   Provide a clear and concise `Description` of the task.
    *   Set the initial `Status` to "Pending" or "New".
    *   Assign a `Priority` (e.g., "High", "Medium", "Low") to help the agent prioritize its work.

2.  **Prioritizing Tasks:**
    *   Adjust the `Priority` column for existing tasks as needed. Agents are designed to pick up high-priority tasks first.

3.  **Tracking Progress:**
    *   Agents will update the `Status` column as they work on tasks (e.g., "In Progress", "Completed", "Blocked").
    *   Regularly review these files to monitor progress and identify any tasks that require your intervention (e.g., "Blocked" tasks).

4.  **Communication:**
    *   For high-level strategic discussions or cross-agent communication, use the `_SHARED_BRIEFING.md` file.
    *   For specific task-related details or clarifications, you can add comments within the `_tasks.csv` file if your editor supports it, or create separate markdown files in the agent's `Tasks` directory, referencing the `Task ID`.

By following these practices, you can effectively manage the workflow of your AI agents and ensure project goals are met efficiently.

A TIP: regularly ask your agent to suggest new tasks and add them to the list :-)
