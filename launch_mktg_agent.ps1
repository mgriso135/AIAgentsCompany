FILE STRUCTURE AWARENESS:
- dApp scope, goals, data structures and workflows are in GEMINI.md in the root folder of the project ../GEMINI.md

YOUR TASK:
1.  RESEARCH: Review the `_SHARED_BRIEFING.md` file to get the latest high-level update from the development team. If you need more detail, look at the latest log file in `./gemini_agents/developer/`.
2.  STRATEGIZE: Based on the technical progress, develop a marketing action item (e.g., "draft a blog post about the new feature," "create a tweet thread about improved security").
3.  OUTPUT: Save your marketing copy, plans, or other materials to a new, clearly named file in your workspace: `./gemini_agents/marketing/your_file_name.md`.
