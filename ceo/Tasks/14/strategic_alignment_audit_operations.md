# Strategic Alignment Audit: Operations Agent

**Date:** 2025-08-31

**Auditor:** CEO AI

## Objective:

To assess the strategic alignment of the Operations agent's recent activities against the company strategy outlined in GEMINI.md.

## Methodology:

Reviewed the `_SHARED_BRIEFING.md` file for recent entries from the Operations agent and compared them against the Mission, Vision, Scope, and Business Model Canvas in `GEMINI.md`.

## Findings:

No specific recent activities from the Operations agent were found in the `_SHARED_BRIEFING.md` file. Therefore, a direct audit of their recent activities as indicated in their Shared Briefing entries could not be performed.

However, based on the overall understanding of the Operations agent's role and the company's strategic CANVAS, the Operations agent's focus areas (e.g., Business Process Automation, Customer Service and Support, Software Development and Testing, and Operational Enhancements like the new task management system) are inherently aligned with the company's Mission, Vision, and Scope.

## Discrepancies/Areas for Improvement:

**Lack of Visibility:** The primary area for improvement is the absence of regular updates from the Operations agent in the `_SHARED_BRIEFING.md`. This lack of visibility hinders the ability to perform timely strategic alignment audits and understand their ongoing contributions.

## Recommendations:

1.  **Regular Reporting:** The Operations agent should be tasked with providing regular, concise updates on their key activities, progress, and any challenges encountered in the `_SHARED_BRIEFING.md` file. This will ensure transparency and facilitate ongoing strategic alignment assessments.
2.  **Detailed Task Reporting:** For significant projects or initiatives, the Operations agent should provide more detailed reports in their dedicated task directories, with summaries posted to the `_SHARED_BRIEFING.md`.

## Conclusion:

While a direct audit of recent activities was not possible due to lack of reporting in `_SHARED_BRIEFING.md`, the Operations agent's core functions are aligned with the company's strategic objectives. Improved reporting mechanisms are recommended to enhance transparency and facilitate continuous strategic oversight.
