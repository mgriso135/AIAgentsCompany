# Strategic CANVAS Communication Plan

## Objective
To ensure all AI agents and human stakeholders have a clear, consistent, and up-to-date understanding of the company's strategic CANVAS, fostering alignment and facilitating effective feedback.

## Communication Channels

### 1. _SHARED_BRIEFING.md
*   **Purpose:** Primary channel for concise, high-level updates and key insights from the CEO AI regarding strategic CANVAS changes or significant findings.
*   **Frequency:** Immediately upon significant updates to the CANVAS or strategic decisions.
*   **Format:** Brief, clear summaries under a dedicated "CEO Strategic Update" section.

### 2. GEMINI.md
*   **Purpose:** The authoritative source for the complete and current strategic CANVAS (Mission, Vision, Scope, Business Model Canvas, Operational Enhancements).
*   **Frequency:** Updated in real-time as strategic decisions are finalized and incorporated.
*   **Access:** All agents and human stakeholders have direct read access.

### 3. CEO AI Memory (ceo_memory.md)
*   **Purpose:** Detailed documentation of strategic decisions, rationale, research findings, and internal review processes related to the CANVAS. Provides historical context and deeper insights.
*   **Frequency:** Updated as strategic tasks are completed or significant findings emerge.
*   **Access:** Primarily for CEO AI internal reference, but accessible for human review.

### 4. Task Management System (Web Interface - under development)
*   **Purpose:** Once developed, this web interface will serve as a centralized, interactive platform for all agents to view, filter, and search tasks, including those related to strategic CANVAS implementation. It will also facilitate direct feedback and progress tracking.
*   **Frequency:** Continuous, real-time updates.
*   **Format:** Interactive UI displaying task details, status, and related strategic context.

## Feedback Collection Mechanisms

### 1. Task Management System (Web Interface - under development)
*   **Mechanism:** Dedicated fields or comment sections within tasks for agents to provide feedback, raise concerns, or suggest revisions related to strategic alignment.
*   **Process:** CEO AI will regularly review feedback submitted through the interface and create new tasks for evaluation and incorporation into the CANVAS as appropriate.

### 2. Direct Communication (for Human Stakeholders)
*   **Mechanism:** Human stakeholders can provide direct feedback or initiate discussions regarding the strategic CANVAS through the CLI interface.
*   **Process:** CEO AI will process direct human input as high-priority directives, creating new tasks for strategic review or CANVAS refinement.

### 3. Strategic Alignment Audits (CEO AI initiated)
*   **Mechanism:** CEO AI will periodically initiate tasks for other agents to conduct self-audits or provide reports on their activities' alignment with the strategic CANVAS.
*   **Process:** Audit findings will be reviewed by the CEO AI, leading to potential CANVAS refinements or new tasks for corrective actions.

## Review and Adaptation
This communication plan will be reviewed and adapted periodically (e.g., quarterly or as significant strategic shifts occur) to ensure its continued effectiveness in maintaining strategic alignment across the company.
