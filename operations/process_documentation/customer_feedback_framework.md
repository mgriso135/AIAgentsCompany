# Customer Feedback Framework for AI Agents

## 1.0 Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document establishes a framework for systematically collecting, analyzing, and acting on customer feedback related to the AI agents developed and deployed by the AI Company. 

### 1.2 Goals
The primary goals of this framework are to:
- Measure and improve customer satisfaction.
- Identify areas for agent improvement and new feature development.
- Strengthen customer relationships by demonstrating responsiveness to their needs.
- Provide data-driven insights to inform product and operational strategy.

## 2.0 Feedback Collection

A multi-channel approach will be used to gather customer feedback.

### 2.1 Proactive Feedback
- **In-Agent Surveys:** Short, contextual surveys will be embedded within the AI agents to capture feedback at the point of interaction. (e.g., a simple "Was this helpful?" with a thumbs up/down).
- **Periodic Email Surveys:** More detailed surveys will be sent to customers on a quarterly basis to gather in-depth feedback on overall satisfaction, agent performance, and feature requests.

### 2.2 Reactive Feedback
- **Support Tickets:** Customer support interactions will be a key source of feedback. Support tickets related to agent performance or behavior will be tagged for analysis.
- **Direct Outreach:** The Customer Success team will conduct regular check-ins with key clients to gather qualitative feedback.

## 3.0 Feedback Analysis

Collected feedback will be centralized and analyzed to identify trends and actionable insights.

### 3.1 Centralization
- All feedback, regardless of the source, will be aggregated into a central repository (e.g., a dedicated database or a specialized feedback analysis tool).

### 3.2 Categorization and Tagging
- Feedback will be categorized (e.g., Bug Report, Feature Request, Usability Issue, Positive Feedback) and tagged with relevant keywords (e.g., agent name, specific feature).

### 3.3 Sentiment Analysis
- Automated sentiment analysis will be used to gauge the overall sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of the feedback.

### 3.4 Root Cause Analysis
- For negative feedback and bug reports, a root cause analysis will be conducted to identify the underlying issue.

## 4.0 Metrics Definition

The following key metrics will be used to measure customer satisfaction and agent performance:

- **Customer Satisfaction (CSAT):** Measured through in-agent and email surveys.
- **Net Promoter Score (NPS):** Measured through quarterly email surveys.
- **Agent-Specific Metrics:**
    - **Task Completion Rate:** The percentage of tasks successfully completed by the agent.
    - **Error Rate:** The frequency of errors or failures.
    - **User Effort Score (UES):** How much effort a user has to expend to get their desired outcome.

## 5.0 Reporting and Action

### 5.1 Reporting
- A monthly "Customer Feedback Insights" report will be generated and shared with all relevant stakeholders (including CEO, Marketing, and Business Development).
- The report will summarize key findings, trends, and metrics.

### 5.2 Action
- **Product Backlog:** Actionable insights and feature requests will be converted into tasks and added to the product development backlog.
- **Process Improvement:** Feedback related to operational issues will be used to drive process improvements.
- **Customer Communication:** Customers will be informed about the actions taken based on their feedback.
