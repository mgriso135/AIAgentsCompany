# Standard Operating Procedure: AI Agent Deployment

## 1.0 Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the standard operating procedure (SOP) for deploying new or updated AI agents into the production environment. The purpose of this SOP is to ensure a consistent, reliable, and secure deployment process, minimizing downtime and operational disruption.

### 1.2 Scope
This SOP applies to all AI agents developed by the AI Company and managed by the Operations team. It covers the entire deployment lifecycle from pre-deployment readiness to post-deployment verification.

## 2.0 Pre-Deployment Checks

Before any deployment, the following checks must be completed and verified.

### 2.1 Code Review and Testing
- **Peer Review:** All code changes have been peer-reviewed and approved by at least one other developer.
- **Unit & Integration Tests:** All unit and integration tests have passed successfully. Test coverage must meet the minimum requirement of 80%.
- **Documentation:** The agent's documentation, including its function, configuration, and dependencies, is complete and up-to-date.

### 2.2 Configuration Management
- **Environment Variables:** All necessary environment variables for the production environment have been identified and are ready to be securely configured.
- **Dependencies:** All external dependencies (e.g., libraries, APIs) are versioned and have been tested for compatibility.

### 2.3 Security Review
- **Vulnerability Scan:** The agent's code and dependencies have been scanned for known vulnerabilities.
- **Permissions:** The agent's required permissions and access levels in the production environment have been defined and follow the principle of least privilege.

### 2.4 Rollback Plan
- A detailed rollback plan is in place to revert to the previous stable version of the agent in case of deployment failure.

## 3.0 Deployment Steps

The deployment will be managed by the human operator, following these steps.

### 3.1 Announce Deployment
- Notify internal stakeholders (e.g., via a shared communication channel) about the upcoming deployment, including the maintenance window and expected impact.

### 3.2 Backup
- Perform a backup of the existing agent and its data (if applicable) before initiating the deployment.

### 3.3 Deploy Agent
- The human operator will execute the deployment script or follow the manual deployment steps as documented in the agent's specific deployment guide.

### 3.4 Configure Environment
- The human operator will apply the production environment variables and configurations.

## 4.0 Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment, the following steps must be taken to verify the agent's functionality.

### 4.1 Health Check
- **Service Availability:** Confirm that the agent's service/endpoint is accessible.
- **Log Monitoring:** The human operator will monitor the agent's logs for any errors or unusual activity for at least 15 minutes post-deployment.

### 4.2 Functional Testing
- **Core Functionality:** Perform a series of pre-defined "smoke tests" to verify the agent's core functionality is working as expected.
- **Integration Points:** Check that the agent is successfully communicating with any external systems or APIs it depends on.

### 4.3 Performance Monitoring
- The human operator will monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) such as response time, error rate, and resource utilization to ensure they are within acceptable limits.

### 4.4 Announce Completion
- Once the deployment is verified as successful, announce the completion to internal stakeholders.
