*   **SME Benefit:** Simplifies regulatory adherence, reduces legal risks, and ensures responsible data handling.

## 4. Market Gaps Addressed by the Toolkit

The proposed toolkit directly addresses several critical market gaps in AI governance solutions for SMEs:

*   **Affordability:** Offers low-cost or freemium options, making AI governance accessible to budget-constrained SMEs.
*   **Simplicity and User-Friendliness:** Designed for ease of use, reducing the need for specialized AI or compliance expertise.
*   **Lack of Expertise:** Provides built-in guidance and simplified tools, compensating for limited in-house AI knowledge.
*   **Regulatory Alignment:** Pre-configured to help SMEs navigate complex and evolving AI regulations.
*   **Data Quality and Bias:** Offers practical tools to manage data quality and identify/mitigate biases.
*   **Transparency and Accountability:** Enables SMEs to understand and communicate AI operations, fostering trust.
