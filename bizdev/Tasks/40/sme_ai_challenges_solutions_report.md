It also proposes solutions that the AI Company can offer to address these challenges, aligning with our mission to empower businesses with intelligent automation.

## 2. Key Challenges

### 2.1. Data Privacy

SMEs face significant data privacy challenges when adopting AI, including:

*   **Data Security:** Lack of resources to implement robust cybersecurity measures to protect sensitive data from breaches.
*   **Regulatory Compliance:** Difficulty navigating complex data privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA.
*   **Lack of Expertise:** Shortage of in-house talent with skills in both AI and data privacy.
*   **Transparency:** The "black box" nature of some AI models makes it difficult to understand how data is being used.

### 2.2. AI Governance

Establishing effective AI governance is a major hurdle for SMEs, with challenges such as:

*   **Resource Constraints:** Limited financial and human resources to develop and implement comprehensive AI governance frameworks.
*   **Regulatory Complexity:** The evolving landscape of AI regulations creates uncertainty and compliance burdens.
*   **Algorithmic Bias:** Difficulty in ensuring that AI models are fair and unbiased without specialized expertise.
*   **Lack of Clear Roles:** Absence of clearly defined roles and responsibilities for AI governance within the organization.

### 2.3. Infrastructure

SMEs often lack the necessary infrastructure to support AI implementation, facing challenges like:

*   **High Costs:** Significant upfront investment required for high-performance hardware and software.
*   **Legacy Systems:** Incompatibility of existing IT infrastructure with modern AI technologies.
*   **Data Silos:** Fragmented and inconsistent data across different systems, hindering the training of effective AI models.
*   **Lack of Technical Expertise:** Shortage of skilled personnel to design, implement, and maintain AI infrastructure.
