## 5. Overall Recommendations for AI Company

All three major cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure) present significant strategic partnership opportunities. We recommend a multi-cloud strategy to leverage the unique strengths of each:

*   **Prioritize deep technology integration with GCP and Azure:** Their advanced generative AI models (Gemini, OpenAI Services) and AI agent development tools (Vertex AI, Azure AI Studio) are highly aligned with our core product development.
*   **Explore co-selling and go-to-market partnerships with all three:** Leverage their extensive SME customer bases and partner programs to expand our market reach.
*   **Focus on their SME-specific programs:** Engage with their startup hubs and accelerator programs to gain access to credits, technical support, and increased visibility.

Further discussions should be initiated with key contacts within each cloud provider's partner ecosystem to explore specific collaboration models and mutual benefits.
