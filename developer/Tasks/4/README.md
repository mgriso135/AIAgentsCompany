# Strategic Alignment Audit for Core Developer Agent

This document summarizes the findings of a strategic alignment audit of the Core Developer agent's activities and proposed tasks.

## Overview

Overall, the Core Developer agent demonstrates strong alignment with the AI Company's strategic CANVAS. Its focus on research and development of cutting-edge AI agent technologies directly supports the company's mission, vision, scope, key activities, and value proposition.

## Key Findings

The detailed findings of the audit are documented in the `report.md` file. The report includes an analysis of alignment against each strategic criterion, identified discrepancies, and specific recommendations for improving strategic alignment.

## Discrepancy

A critical discrepancy identified is the non-functional `create_task` command-line interface in `backend/core_developer_api_client.py`. This issue is a significant operational bottleneck that needs immediate resolution.

## Recommendations

1.  **Prioritize Fix for `create_task` (Task ID 208):** Investigate and resolve the `create_task` command-line interface issue.
2.  **Integrate Ethical AI Explicitly:** Future R&D tasks should explicitly incorporate ethical AI considerations.
3.  **Document SME Relevance Consistently:** Ensure potential benefits and applications for SMEs are clearly articulated in R&D reports and plans.

## Validation

The audit findings were validated through comprehensive data review, cross-referencing with the Strategic CANVAS, and logical consistency checks. The validation process is documented in the `tests.md` file.
