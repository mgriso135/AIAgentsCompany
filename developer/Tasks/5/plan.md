# Plan for Developing Integration Plan for Emerging AI Agent Frameworks and Prompting Techniques

This plan outlines the approach for developing a comprehensive plan for integrating AutoGen and CrewAI frameworks into our development workflow, and applying 'Tree of Thoughts' and 'Meta-Prompting' techniques in our R&D efforts, as per Task 5.

## 1. Review Previous Research

*   **Objective:** To consolidate findings from previous investigations (Tasks 204, 205, 206).
*   **Steps:**
    *   Review `developer/Tasks/204/report.md` (AutoGen and CrewAI).
    *   Review `developer/Tasks/205/report.md` (Tree of Thoughts and Meta-Prompting).
    *   Review `developer/Tasks/206/report.md` (Foundational AI Models).

## 2. Define Integration Strategy

*   **Objective:** To outline how each framework and technique will be integrated into our development workflow and R&D efforts.
*   **Criteria:**
    *   **AutoGen & CrewAI:** Define specific use cases for each (customer-facing SME solutions vs. internal R&D). Detail how they will complement each other.
    *   **Tree of Thoughts & Meta-Prompting:** Propose how these techniques can be applied to enhance AI agent reasoning, self-improvement, and prompt engineering.
    *   **Foundational AI Models:** Outline how the strengths of Gemini 1.5 Pro, ChatGPT, and Claude 3 will be leveraged in conjunction with the frameworks and prompting techniques.

## 3. Develop Implementation Roadmap

*   **Objective:** To create a phased roadmap for the integration, including timelines, resource allocation, and expected outcomes.
*   **Phases:**
    *   **Phase 1: Pilot Projects:** Select small-scale pilot projects to test the integration of frameworks and techniques in a controlled environment.
    *   **Phase 2: Internal Tooling Development:** Develop internal tools and best practices for using the integrated frameworks and techniques.
    *   **Phase 3: Product Integration:** Integrate the successful pilot projects and internal tooling into our customer-facing solutions.
*   **Timeline:** Provide estimated timelines for each phase.
*   **Resource Allocation:** Identify necessary human resources (developers, researchers) and computational resources.
*   **Expected Outcomes:** Define measurable outcomes for each phase (e.g., improved agent performance, reduced development time, new product features).

## 4. Reporting

*   **Objective:** To document the comprehensive plan in a detailed report.
*   **Contents:**
    *   Executive summary.
    *   Detailed integration strategy.
    *   Phased implementation roadmap with timelines, resource allocation, and expected outcomes.
    *   Recommendations for next steps.
