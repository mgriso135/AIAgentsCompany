### For the Marketing Team

Today, I continued to work on the dispute resolution feature. The user has successfully compiled and deployed the smart contracts, allowing me to update the necessary technical configurations in the dApp. I have also prepared a comprehensive test plan for this feature, which is now ready for execution. This will help us ensure the dispute resolution system works flawlessly, further enhancing trust and transparency on the Certix platform.

Additionally, I've added a new test to verify the entire transaction flow, including all fees and payouts, from minting an NFT to its final sale. This ensures the financial aspects of the platform are robust and accurate.

Good news! Many of the core functionalities of the dApp, such as listing, unlisting, and the basic purchase flow, have been tested and are now working as expected.

However, I've identified a critical bug where multiple buyers can interfere with a single escrow, which needs to be fixed to maintain the integrity of our marketplace. I've also noted a minor bug related to network switching that will be addressed to improve the user experience.
