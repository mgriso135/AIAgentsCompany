# Developer Log - 2025-08-20

## Task Understanding

Understood my role as the lead developer for Certix, responsible for coding, bug fixing, and documentation. My primary goal for today was to review the project status and await a specific development task.

## Project Review

*   **`GEMINI.md`:** Reviewed the `GEMINI.md` file to understand the Certix dApp's architecture, core problems it aims to solve, key features, data structures, and workflows. Noted the "Next Steps" which include implementing dispute resolution and developing a comprehensive test plan.
*   **`_SHARED_BRIEFING.md`:** Checked the shared briefing file, which was empty.

## Test Plan Discovery and Initial Findings

*   **Search for Test Results:** The user asked about the latest results of the testing plan. I searched for relevant files in the project directory.
*   **Identified Test Files:** Found `TESTING.csv`, `TESTING.md`, `TESTING.xlsx`, and `Tests.xlsx`.
*   **`TESTING.md` Analysis:** Read `TESTING.md` which contained a comprehensive test plan with `Test Case ID`, `Description`, `Steps to Reproduce`, and `Expected Result` columns. However, the `Actual Result` and `Status` columns were empty, indicating that the tests had been planned but not yet executed.
*   **`.xlsx` File Attempts:** Attempted to read `TESTING.xlsx` and `Tests.xlsx` but was unable to display their content (binary files).
*   **`TESTING.csv` Analysis:** Read `TESTING.csv` which mirrored the content of `TESTING.md`, also with empty `Actual Result` and `Status` columns.

## User-Provided Test Results and Updates

The user provided the following test results:

*   `WM-001`: PASSED
*   `WM-002`: PASSED
*   `WM-003`: FAILED (User clarified this was the intended failed test, not a duplicate of WM-002) - "The dApp never told me I was switching network, neither in the console."
*   `MF-001`: PASSED

Based on these results, I updated the `TESTING.md` file:

*   Set `WM-001` to `PASSED`.
*   Set `WM-002` to `PASSED`.
*   Set `WM-003` to `FAILED`.
*   Set `MF-001` to `PASSED`.

## Next Steps

My immediate next step is to investigate the failure of test case `WM-003`. I will start by examining `WalletContext.tsx` to understand how network changes are handled and why the dApp is not prompting the user to switch back to the Sepolia network.
