### Task: Dispute Resolution (Task 2)

**Summary:**

I continued the work on the dispute resolution feature. I reviewed the existing documentation and the frontend implementation in `ProductPage.tsx`. The frontend code appears to be complete and aligned with the feature requirements.

**ABI Update:**

The user has compiled and deployed the smart contracts. I have successfully extracted the updated ABIs for `CertixNFT.sol` and `ProductEscrow.sol` from the `artifacts/` directory and updated the `constants.ts` file accordingly.

**Test Plan for Dispute Resolution Feature:**

I have created a detailed test plan for the dispute resolution feature, including test cases for opening a dispute, submitting evidence, and resolving a dispute. This plan has been added to `TESTING.csv`.

**New Test Case: Full Transaction Flow with Fee Verification (TC-TF-001)**

I have added a new comprehensive test case to `TESTING.csv` that covers the entire NFT transaction lifecycle, from minting to sale completion, with a focus on verifying transaction amounts and fees (minting fee, listing price, escrow funding, platform fee, and seller payout).

**Bug Fix Proposal:**

Based on the initial test results provided by the user, I have identified a bug related to network change detection (WM-003). I have proposed a new task (Task 9) to address this issue.

**Updated Test Results (from user):**

The user has provided updated test results for Task 1. Several previously skipped tests (MF-003, MF-004, MF-005, MF-006, MP-001, MP-002, MP-003, MP-004) are now passing, indicating that the core transaction flow is largely functional.

**Critical Bug Identified (MP-005):**

A critical bug was identified in test case MP-005, where a buyer was able to fund an escrow initiated by another buyer. This breaks the integrity of the escrow system. I have proposed a new high-priority bug fix task (Task 10) to address this issue.

**Next Steps:**

I am now ready for the user to execute the remaining test cases in `TESTING.csv`, particularly the dispute resolution features (TC-DR-001 to TC-DR-006) and the full transaction fee verification (TC-TF-001). I will await the results of these tests to proceed with any further adjustments or finalization of the feature.
