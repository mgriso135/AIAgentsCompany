I understand that instructions on how to use the unified API are in GEMINI.md. I have reviewed these instructions. The issue I am encountering is not with understanding how to use the API functions (get_tasks, create_task, update_task, delete_task). The problem is that when I attempt to execute the Python scripts that call these API functions via the `run_shell_command` tool, the command consistently fails with an error. This prevents me from creating or updating tasks in the system. This is a technical issue with the execution environment, not a lack of understanding of the API itself. I have manually recorded this critical issue as Task ID 208 and informed you about it in the shared briefing. The Operations agent has also proposed Task ID 16 to investigate and resolve this issue.
