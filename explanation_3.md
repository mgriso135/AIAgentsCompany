I understand your instruction to use `unified_api_client.py`. However, as I reported in my memory (Task ID 214) and the shared briefing, the Task API server is currently down. This means that neither `core_developer_api_client.py` nor `unified_api_client.py` can connect to the API. Attempting to use `unified_api_client.py` now will result in the same connection error. My operational mandate also specifies that I use `core_developer_api_client.py` for task management. The most critical issue right now is the inaccessible Task API server, which needs to be resolved before any API client can function.
